# Architecture Documentation

This section documents the high-level architecture of the Radius Method application.

## Architecture Overview

The Radius Method application is built using Next.js with the App Router architecture, focusing on modern React patterns and best practices.

## Architecture Topics

- [Component Structure](./component-structure.md) - Overview of the component architecture
- [Styling Approach](./styling-approach.md) - Documentation on the CSS module pattern used
- [Next.js Patterns](./nextjs-patterns.md) - Implementation of Next.js App Router features

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Next.js App Router** - Using the latest Next.js App Router architecture for improved performance and simplified routing
2. **TypeScript** - Strong typing throughout the application for improved maintainability
3. **CSS Modules** - Encapsulated styling to prevent style conflicts
4. **Client/Server Component Separation** - Clear delineation between server and client components
5. **Component Composition** - Building complex UIs through composition of smaller components
