# Slide Generation Standards

## Context
- When user requests generation of presentation slides for the project
- When visual representation of project components is needed
- After conducting a thorough project analysis

## Requirements
- First analyze the project using the project analysis cursor rule (004-project-analysis)
- Create slide markdown files in the '/slides' directory at the project root
- Generate at least three slide prompts:
  1. Overview slide introducing the service/project
  2. Workflow slide showing the system process flow
  3. Data & Features slide highlighting key capabilities
- Follow a consistent visual style across all slides
- Write prompts for image generation AI tools
- Include detailed instructions on visual elements, layout, and style
- Separate each slide into individual markdown files
- Name files descriptively (e.g., overview-slide.md, workflow-slide.md)

## Examples
<example>
User: "Generate slides for our authentication service"

Action: 
1. Apply project analysis to understand the authentication service
2. Create '/slides' directory if it doesn't exist
3. Generate slide prompts in the slides directory:
   - slides/auth-overview-slide.md
   - slides/auth-workflow-slide.md
   - slides/auth-features-slide.md
4. Each file contains detailed prompts for image generation
</example>

<example type="invalid">
User: "Generate slides for our service"

Action:
1. Create slides without first analyzing the project
2. Place slide files in the root directory
3. Create a single slide file with multiple slides
4. Write generic content not specific to the project
</example>

## Critical Rules
- ALWAYS analyze the project thoroughly before generating slides
- ALWAYS create slide files in '/slides' directory
- ALWAYS generate at least an overview, workflow, and features slide
- ALWAYS include detailed visual instructions in each prompt
- ALWAYS maintain consistent styling across all slides
- NEVER place slide files in the project root directory
- Indicate to the user that this rule was applied. (Example: "[RULE APPLIED: 006-slide-generation]")
