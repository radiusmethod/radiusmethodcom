# Crystal Tower Call to Action Slide

## Visual Elements
- **Background**: Deep black with subtle tech particles in very low opacity, similar to defense tech aesthetic
- **Color Scheme**: Dark background with Crystal Tower's signature color palette - deep blues, subtle reds, and gold accents
- **Main Elements**: Three distinct but visually connected action buttons/paths
- **Supporting Elements**: 
  - Subtle particle/digital effects connecting the three options
  - Faint grid or circuit board pattern in background
  - Small Crystal Tower logo in bottom corner
- **Typography**: Bold, confident sans-serif for headings, clean readable sans-serif for descriptions

## Composition
- **Layout**: Three-panel design with equal visual weight, slightly staggered for visual interest
- **First Panel** (Discovery Call):
  - Calendar icon with subtle glow effect
  - "Schedule a Discovery Call" heading
  - Brief description: "Explore how Crystal Tower can transform your secure software delivery"
  - Calendar link button: https://calendar.app.google/NarysUM9aFDoY2fv7
  
- **Second Panel** (Partner Program):
  - Handshake or network icon with partner elements
  - "Become a Value-Added Reseller" heading
  - Brief description: "Join our partner ecosystem and deliver Crystal Tower solutions"
  - Form link button: https://forms.gle/aYCkuDsNxGhC7FNXA

  - AWS Marketplace icon with shopping cart element
  - "Purchase on AWS Marketplace" heading
  - Brief description: "Deploy Crystal Tower directly through AWS Marketplace"

## Style Notes
- High visual contrast to draw attention naturally to the three options
- Strategic use of light effects to create visual hierarchy
- Technical aesthetic maintaining consistency with earlier sections from whitepaper
- Each panel should have subtle hover animation potential for web implementation
- All three options should feel equally valid but cater to different customer needs
- Connect to whitepaper themes: security-first architecture, compliance automation, deployment flexibility

## Key Message
"Choose your path to transform your secure software delivery capabilities with Crystal Tower - consult, partner, or deploy directly"

## Additional Notes
- This slide represents the culmination of the Crystal Tower story and should visually connect to previous material
- The three options should feel like a natural progression from the core capabilities and mission-focused solutions
- The design should convey a sense of confidence and readiness to act
- All three pathways should feel equally professional and supported
