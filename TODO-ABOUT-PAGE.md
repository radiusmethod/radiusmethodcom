# TODO: Enhance About Page Professional Styling and Assets

## Background
The current About page has placeholder SVG components that need to be refined for a more professional look. The page structure is in place, but all graphics need to be improved to better match the company's professional identity while ensuring they align with the dark theme. Team member information also needs to be standardized with the CEO's actual information preserved while using placeholder data for other positions.
